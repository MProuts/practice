Fix the errors:

Onceu po na time

- Yank "something", delete "foo", replace it with "something"
- Yank "something", visually select "foo", replace it with "something"
NOTE: paste replaces unnamed register with selection
- Yank "something", change foo, paste from unnamed register in insert mode
NOTE: easier to gauge where insertion is going

Inspect the unnamed and yank registers.

Paste from registers:
- The name of the current file

- The name of the alternate file

- The last inserted text

- The last Ex command

- The last search pattern

Swap "fish" and "chips"

I like chips and fish.

Duplicate the current row, paste it above and below the current row,
both times with cursor below insertion.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Foo</td>
    <td>Bar</td>
  </tr>
</table>
